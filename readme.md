### Rails Command Line Framework


## Introduction

Hi! I am a simple template project that will make it easy to create command line applications in ruby.  

I set up support for the following libraries:
- bundler / gems
- active support
- rSpec

Features:
- really minimal project
- ensure that only once instance of this application is running at a time (if I were to be scheduled by cron)
- logging
- familiar rails-like project structure

## Use

# Setup
- gem install bundler
- bundle install

# Running the application
- ./main

# Running the tests
